Update dashboard.js to fix the lead detail form validation and modal closing behavior:

1. Fix the validation logic:
   - Prevent form submission unless one of the validation conditions is met:
     a. Both Next contact date (future date within one month) AND Discussion summary are filled in
     b. Handover note is filled in AND at least one department-specific action button is selected
   - Add a validation function that runs before form submission
   - If validation fails, show specific error messages indicating what needs to be completed
   - Do not allow the form to submit if validation fails

2. Fix the modal closing behavior:
   - Prevent the modal from closing when clicking outside the modal
   - Disable the "Cancel" button initially
   - Only enable the "Cancel" button when one of the validation conditions is met
   - Add a "Save and Close" button that validates before closing
   - Remove or disable the close button (X) in the modal header

3. Add visual validation feedback:
   - Highlight required fields that are empty
   - Show error messages next to fields that need attention
   - Add visual indicators (like checkmarks or color changes) when fields are completed
   - Display a summary of validation errors at the top of the form

4. Update the modal structure:
   - Change the form submission button to "Save and Close"
   - Keep the "Cancel" button disabled until validation passes
   - Remove the close button (X) from the modal header
   - Prevent modal close on outside click

5. Ensure the validation logic works correctly:
   - Next contact date must be a future date within one month from today
   - Discussion summary must not be empty
   - Handover note must not be empty
   - At least one action button must be selected
   - Clear error messages when validation fails
   - Success feedback when validation passes and form is submitted

The lead detail form should enforce the business rules and prevent users from closing without completing the required actions.
